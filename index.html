                    <p>In today’s highly regulated environment, <a href="https://www.maxlewis.com.sg/our-services/transfer-pricing/">transfer pricing</a> (TP) reporting is not something companies should take lightly. Some firms may be tempted to opt for a simplified TP report to save time and costs. However, this approach can be fraught with risks, especially if the business does not qualify for the simplified reporting scheme or fails to meet its strict requirements.</p>

                    </section>
                    <h2>Understanding Simplified TP Reports</h2>
                    <p>The guidelines for a simplified TP report are clearly outlined in the transfer pricing rules, particularly in clauses 6.32 (a) to (e). Companies must fulfill all the criteria to qualify for a simplified report. However, it is essential to recognise that not every business model qualifies under this scheme. From practical experience, many companies do not meet these requirements, especially those involved in more complex transactions like repair services.</p>
                    <p>Some businesses may wrongly believe that a simplified TP report can be filed on a three-year cycle, which is incorrect. Simplified reporting is not suitable for all types of transactions, especially when complex transactions are involved. For instance, a company with rising figures, such as moving from SGD 11 million in 2022 to SGD 13 million in 2023, may not fit the criteria for simplified reporting.</p>
                    <h2>The Risks of Opting for Simplified Reports</h2>
                    <p>Some firms may market simplified TP reports as a way to cut costs, but companies should be cautious. Simplified reports primarily involve making declarations and attaching past full TP reports. While this may sound appealing, the risks associated with taking this approach can outweigh the benefits.</p>

                    <p>Consider the following risks:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Business Model Variations</b>: A company’s operating margin may fluctuate year to year. Without a <a href="https://www.maxlewis.com.sg/how-to-conduct-effective-benchmarking-for-tp-purposes/">detailed benchmarking analysis</a> for each financial period, relying on simplified reporting could result in discrepancies that raise red flags during an audit.</li>
                        <li><b>Potential for Rejection</b>: If a simplified report is submitted and subsequently rejected by the authorities, the company may face an urgent need to prepare a full TP report, leading to last-minute scrambling and additional costs.</li>
                        <li><b>Lack of Benchmarking</b>: A full TP report typically includes a comprehensive benchmarking study to support each operating margin percentage. This provides a more robust defense in the event of an audit, offering greater assurance and compliance.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Why Full TP Reports Offer Better Protection</h2>
                    <p>When submitting full TP documentation, the process includes thorough benchmarking to substantiate each aspect of the transfer pricing arrangement. This ensures that the company’s transfer prices are set at arm’s length, providing greater protection in the event of an audit.</p>
                    <p>While some firms may opt for simplified reports to save costs, this approach could lead to greater risks and potentially higher costs if the company’s transfer pricing practices are challenged by tax authorities. Companies should weigh the potential risks against the savings and consider whether a full report is a more prudent choice.</p>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>In conclusion, taking shortcuts in transfer pricing reporting may seem like a cost-effective solution, but it could result in more significant risks down the line. By opting for a full TP report, businesses can ensure compliance, reduce the risk of penalties, and have peace of mind that their documentation is robust and defensible.</p>
